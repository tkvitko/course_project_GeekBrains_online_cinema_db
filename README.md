<h1>SQL Database for Online Cinema</h1>

This is my study project.

Here you can find the dababase for online cinema.
End user can sign up to the service, pay the subscription and watch the content during paid period without limitations.
Content represents movies, series (consisting of episodes) and tv shows.

There are persons in different roles in each of the content.
One person can play different roles (an actor, a creator) in different movies.
Content is divided into packages. Package and period form a product (with price), that can be pirchsed by a user.
